This is my LMS project's Backend Code based on the MERN Stack 

while building this project , I gained alot of precious knowledge about the backend development in general 

I learnt about the user authentication , authorization , tokens , passwordEncryptions , and various other functionalities that you can check in the code 

I also used various packages including multer , morgon , nodemailer, jsonwebtoken etc(can be seen in the dependencies section of package.json file)

During this project , I also faced numerous logical issues , which I feel that really helped me to broaden my mental horizon to backend development .

please share your valuable feedback and suggestions and feel free to contact me regarding any queries about this project
